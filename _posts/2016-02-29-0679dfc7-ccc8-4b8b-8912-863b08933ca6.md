Testing the grid. Hey there, Mr. Robot. Can you hear me?

And what happens if I just continue to type while I'm being summoned to help the better half cook in the kitchen? How long will it take for him to snap and see that I'm dicking around with a new piece of AI software that has frankly got a long way to go before I'm chill with moving all my work onto it?

I'm interested in seeing how long all this sweet sweet typing can last before this text gets thrust onto the link page, never to be seen again.
